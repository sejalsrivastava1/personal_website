    <h1>about me, sejal :)</h1>
    <div class="main">
        <p>hey! my name is sejal srivastava. i'm a current junior at <a href="https://www.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins University</a> studying computer science. i started off college as an environmental engineering major, but i wasn't really sure what i wanted out of life, to be honest. although i had never really coded before, i knew i wanted to learn. so, i started talking a few CS courses here and there. finally, i realized that although my CS courses were the hardest classes i was taking, i enjoyed them much more than any other courses i had taken in my life. so, i made the leap to switch my major completely to computer science, and here we are!</p>
        <p>now, i'm building experience in the field of computer science through personal projects (like this one!), as well as working as a software developer at <a href="brainlit.neurodata.io">the neurodata lab</a>.</p>
